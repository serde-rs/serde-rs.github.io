# Getting help

Serde is one of the most widely used Rust libraries so any place that Rustaceans
congregate will be able to help you out. For chat, consider trying the
[#rust-questions] or [#rust-beginners] channels of the unofficial community
Discord (invite: <https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community>), the [#rust-usage] or
[#beginners] channels of the official Rust Project Discord (invite:
<https://discord.gg/rust-lang>), or the [#general][zulip] stream in Zulip. For
asynchronous, consider the [\[rust\] tag on StackOverflow][stackoverflow], the
[/r/rust] subreddit which has a pinned weekly easy questions post, or the Rust
[Discourse forum][discourse].
