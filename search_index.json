 \n  \n  \n\n\n\nSerde\nSerde is a framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data\nstructures efficiently and generically.\nThe Serde ecosystem consists of data structures that know how to serialize and\ndeserialize themselves along with data formats that know how to serialize and\ndeserialize other things. Serde provides the layer by which these two groups\ninteract with each other, allowing any supported data structure to be serialized\nand deserialized using any supported data format.\n\n\nDesign\nWhere many other languages rely on runtime reflection for serializing data,\nSerde is instead built on Rust's powerful trait system. A data structure that\nknows how to serialize and deserialize itself is one that implements Serde's\nSerialize and Deserialize traits (or uses Serde's derive attribute to\nautomatically generate implementations at compile time). This avoids any\noverhead of reflection or runtime type information. In fact in many situations\nthe interaction between data structure and data format can be completely\noptimized away by the Rust compiler, leaving Serde serialization to perform\nthe same speed as a handwritten serializer for the specific selection of data\nstructure and data format.\nData formats\nThe following is a partial list of data formats that have been implemented for\nSerde by the community.\n\nJSON, the ubiquitous JavaScript Object Notation used by many HTTP APIs.\nPostcard, a no_std and embedded-systems friendly compact binary format.\nCBOR, a Concise Binary Object Representation designed for small message size\nwithout the need for version negotiation.\nYAML, a self-proclaimed human-friendly configuration language that ain't\nmarkup language.\nMessagePack, an efficient binary format that resembles a compact JSON.\nTOML, a minimal configuration format used by Cargo.\nPickle, a format common in the Python world.\nRON, a Rusty Object Notation.\nBSON, the data storage and network transfer format used by MongoDB.\nAvro, a binary format used within Apache Hadoop, with support for schema\ndefinition.\nJSON5, a superset of JSON including some productions from ES5.\nURL query strings, in the x-www-form-urlencoded format.\nStarlark, the format used for describing build targets by the Bazel and Buck\nbuild systems. (serialization only)\nEnvy, a way to deserialize environment variables into Rust structs.\n(deserialization only)\nEnvy Store, a way to deserialize AWS Parameter Store parameters into Rust\nstructs. (deserialization only)\nS-expressions, the textual representation of code and data used by the Lisp\nlanguage family.\nD-Bus's binary wire format.\nFlexBuffers, the schemaless cousin of Google's FlatBuffers zero-copy\nserialization format.\nBencode, a simple binary format used in the BitTorrent protocol.\nToken streams, for processing Rust procedural macro input. (deserialization\nonly)\nDynamoDB Items, the format used by rusoto_dynamodb to transfer data to\nand from DynamoDB.\nHjson, a syntax extension to JSON designed around human reading and editing.\n(deserialization only)\nCSV, Comma-separated values is a tabular text file format.\n\nData structures\nOut of the box, Serde is able to serialize and deserialize common Rust data\ntypes in any of the above formats. For example String, &str, usize,\nVec, HashMap are all supported. In addition, Serde provides a derive\nmacro to generate serialization implementations for structs in your own program.\nUsing the derive macro goes like this:\nuse serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\nstruct Point {\n    x: i32,\n    y: i32,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };\n\n    // Convert the Point to a JSON string.\n    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&point).unwrap();\n\n    // Prints serialized = {\"x\":1,\"y\":2}\n    println!(\"serialized = {}\", serialized);\n\n    // Convert the JSON string back to a Point.\n    let deserialized: Point = serde_json::from_str(&serialized).unwrap();\n\n    // Prints deserialized = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }\n    println!(\"deserialized = {:?}\", deserialized);\n}\n\n"},"help.html":{"url":"help.html","title":"Help","keywords":"","body":"Getting help\nSerde is one of the most widely used Rust libraries so any place that Rustaceans\ncongregate will be able to help you out.

You can think of it as Serde's type system.\nIn code, the serialization half of the Serde data model is defined by the\nSerializer trait and the deserialization half is defined by the\nDeserializer trait. These are a way of mapping every Rust data structure\ninto one of 29 possible types. Each method of the Serializer trait corresponds\nto one of the types of the data model.\nWhen serializing a data structure to some format, the Serialize\nimplementation for the data structure is responsible for mapping the data\nstructure into the Serde data model by invoking exactly one of the Serializer\nmethods, while the Serializer implementation for the data format is\nresponsible for mapping the Serde data model into the intended output\nrepresentation.\nWhen deserializing a data structure from some format, the Deserialize\nimplementation for the data structure is responsible for mapping the data\nstructure into the Serde data model by passing to the Deserializer a\nVisitor implementation that can receive the various types of the data model,\nwhile the Deserializer implementation for the data format is responsible for\nmapping the input data into the Serde data model by invoking exactly one of the\nVisitor methods.\nTypes\nThe Serde data model is a simplified form of Rust's type system. It consists of\nthe following 29 types:\n\n14 primitive types\nbool\ni8, i16, i32, i64, i128\nu8, u16, u32, u64, u128\nf32, f64\nchar\n\n\nstring\nUTF-8 bytes with a length and no null terminator. May contain 0-bytes.\nWhen serializing, all strings are handled equally. When deserializing, there\nare three flavors of strings: transient, owned, and borrowed. This\ndistinction is explained in Understanding deserializer lifetimes and is a\nkey way that Serde enabled efficient zero-copy deserialization.\n\n\nbyte array - [u8]\nSimilar to strings, during deserialization byte arrays can be transient,\nowned, or borrowed.\n\n\noption\nEither none or some value.\n\n\nunit\nThe type of () in Rust. It represents an anonymous value containing no\ndata.\n\n\nunit_struct\nFor example struct Unit or PhantomData. It represents a named value\ncontaining no data.\n\n\nunit_variant\nFor example the E::A and E::B in enum E { A, B }.\n\n\nnewtype_struct\nFor example struct Millimeters(u8).\n\n\nnewtype_variant\nFor example the E::N in enum E { N(u8) }.\n\n\nseq\nA variably sized heterogeneous sequence of values, for example Vec or\nHashSet. When serializing, the length may or may not be known before\niterating through all the data. When deserializing, the length is determined\nby looking at the serialized data. Note that a homogeneous Rust collection\nlike vec![Value::Bool(true), Value::Char('c')] may serialize as a\nheterogeneous Serde seq, in this case containing a Serde bool followed by a\nSerde char.\n\n\ntuple\nA statically sized heterogeneous sequence of values for which the length\nwill be known at deserialization time without looking at the serialized\ndata, for example (u8,) or (String, u64, Vec) or [u64; 10].\n\n\ntuple_struct\nA named tuple, for example struct Rgb(u8, u8, u8).\n\n\ntuple_variant\nFor example the E::T in enum E { T(u8, u8) }.\n\n\nmap\nA variably sized heterogeneous key-value pairing, for example BTreeMap. When serializing, the length may or may not be known before iterating\nthrough all the entries. When deserializing, the length is determined by\nlooking at the serialized data.\n\n\nstruct\nA statically sized heterogeneous key-value pairing in which the keys are\ncompile-time constant strings and will be known at deserialization time\nwithout looking at the serialized data, for example struct S { r: u8, g:\nu8, b: u8 }.\n\n\nstruct_variant\nFor example the E::S in enum E { S { r: u8, g: u8, b: u8 } }.\n\n\n\nMapping into the data model\nIn the case of most Rust types, their mapping into the Serde data model is\nstraightforward. For example the Rust bool type corresponds to Serde's bool\ntype. The Rust tuple struct Rgb(u8, u8, u8) corresponds to Serde's tuple\nstruct type.\nBut there is no fundamental reason that these mappings need to be\nstraightforward. The Serialize and Deserialize traits can perform any\nmapping between Rust type and Serde data model that is appropriate for the use\ncase.\nAs an example, consider Rust's std::ffi::OsString type. This type represents\na platform-native string. On Unix systems they are arbitrary non-zero bytes and\non Windows systems they are arbitrary non-zero 16-bit values. It may seem\nnatural to map OsString into the Serde data model as one of the following\ntypes:\n\nAs a Serde string. Unfortunately serialization would be brittle because an\nOsString is not guaranteed to be representable in UTF-8 and deserialization\nwould be brittle because Serde strings are allowed to contain 0-bytes.\nAs a Serde byte array. This fixes both problems with using string, but now\nif we serialize an OsString on Unix and deserialize it on Windows we end up\nwith the wrong string.\n\nInstead the Serialize and Deserialize impls for OsString map into the\nSerde data model by treating OsString as a Serde enum. Effectively it acts\nas though OsString were defined as the following type, even though this does\nnot match its definition on any individual platform.\nenum OsString {\n    Unix(Vec),\n    Windows(Vec),\n    // and other platforms\n}\n\nThe flexibility around mapping into the Serde data model is profound and\npowerful. When implementing Serialize and Deserialize, be aware of the\nbroader context of your type that may make the most instinctive mapping not the\nbest choice.\n"},"derive.html":{"url":"derive.html","title":"Using derive","keywords":"","body":"Using derive\nSerde provides a derive macro to generate implementations of the Serialize and\nDeserialize traits for data structures defined in your crate, allowing them to\nbe represented conveniently in all of Serde's data formats.\nYou only need to set this up if your code is using #[derive(Serialize,\nDeserialize)].\nThis functionality is based on Rust's #[derive] mechanism, just like what you\nwould use to automatically derive implementations of the built-in Clone,\nCopy, Debug, or other traits. It is able to generate implementations for\nmost structs and enums including ones with elaborate generic types or trait\nbounds. On rare occasions, for an especially convoluted type you may need to\nimplement the traits manually.\nThese derives require a Rust compiler version 1.31 or newer.\n\nAdd serde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] } as a dependency in\nCargo.toml.\nEnsure that all other Serde-based dependencies (for example serde_json) are on\na version that is compatible with serde 1.0.\nOn structs and enums that you want to serialize, import the derive macro as\nuse serde::Serialize; within the same module and write\n#[derive(Serialize)] on the struct or enum.\nSimilarly import use serde::Deserialize; and write #[derive(Deserialize)]\non structs and enums that you want to deserialize.\n\nHere is the Cargo.toml:\nCargo.toml\n[package]\nname = \"my-crate\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"Me \"]\n\n[dependencies]\nserde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\n\n# serde_json is just for the example, not required in general\nserde_json = \"1.0\"\n\nNow the src/main.rs which uses Serde's custom derives:\nsrc/main.rs\nuse serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\nstruct Point {\n    x: i32,\n    y: i32,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };\n\n    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&point).unwrap();\n    println!(\"serialized = {}\", serialized);\n\n    let deserialized: Point = serde_json::from_str(&serialized).unwrap();\n    println!(\"deserialized = {:?}\", deserialized);\n}\n\nHere is the output:\n$ cargo run\nserialized = {\"x\":1,\"y\":2}\ndeserialized = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }\nTroubleshooting\nSometimes you may see compile-time errors that tell you:\nthe trait `serde::ser::Serialize` is not implemented for `...`\neven though the struct or enum clearly has #[derive(Serialize)] on it.\nThis almost always means that you are using libraries that depend on\nincompatible versions of Serde. You may be depending on serde 1.0 in your\nCargo.toml but using some other library that depends on serde 0.9. So the\nSerialize trait from serde 1.0 may be implemented, but the library expects an\nimplementation of the Serialize trait from serde 0.9.

The distinction\nSerde makes is that serialize_tuple is for sequences where the length does not\nneed to be serialized because it will be known at deserialization time. The\nusual examples are Rust tuples and arrays. In non-self-describing formats a\nVec needs to be serialized with its length in order to be able to\ndeserialize a Vec back out. But a [T; 16] can be serialized using\nserialize_tuple because the length will be known at deserialization time\nwithout looking at the serialized bytes.\nSerializing a struct\nSerde distinguishes between four types of structs. Ordinary structs and tuple\nstructs follow the three-step process of init, elements, end just like a\nsequence or map. Newtype structs and unit structs are more like primitives.\n// An ordinary struct. Use three-step process:\n//   1. serialize_struct\n//   2. serialize_field\n//   3. end\nstruct Color {\n    r: u8,\n    g: u8,\n    b: u8,\n}\n\n// A tuple struct. Use three-step process:\n//   1. serialize_tuple_struct\n//   2. serialize_field\n//   3. end\nstruct Point2D(f64, f64);\n\n// A newtype struct. Use serialize_newtype_struct.\nstruct Inches(u64);\n\n// A unit struct. Use serialize_unit_struct.\nstruct Instance;\n\nStructs and maps may look similar in some formats, including JSON. The\ndistinction Serde makes is that structs have keys that are compile-time constant\nstrings and will be known at deserialization time without looking at the\nserialized data. This condition enables some data formats to handle structs much\nmore efficiently and compactly than maps.\nData formats are encouraged to treat newtype structs as insignificant wrappers\naround the inner value, serializing just the inner value. See for example\nJSON's treatment of newtype structs.\nuse serde::ser::{Serialize, Serializer, SerializeStruct};\n\nstruct Color {\n    r: u8,\n    g: u8,\n    b: u8,\n}\n\nimpl Serialize for Color {\n    fn serialize(&self, serializer: S) -> Result\n    where\n        S: Serializer,\n    {\n        // 3 is the number of fields in the struct.\n        let mut state = serializer.serialize_struct(\"Color\", 3)?;\n        state.serialize_field(\"r\", &self.r)?;\n        state.serialize_field(\"g\", &self.g)?;\n        state.serialize_field(\"b\", &self.b)?;\n        state.end()\n    }\n}\n\nSerializing an enum\nSerializing enum variants is very similar to serializing structs.\nenum E {\n    // Use three-step process:\n    //   1. serialize_struct_variant\n    //   2. serialize_field\n    //   3. end\n    Color { r: u8, g: u8, b: u8 },\n\n    // Use three-step process:\n    //   1. serialize_tuple_variant\n    //   2. serialize_field\n    //   3. end\n    Point2D(f64, f64),\n\n    // Use serialize_newtype_variant.\n    Inches(u64),\n\n    // Use serialize_unit_variant.\n    Instance,\n}\n\nOther special cases\nThere are two more special cases that are part of the Serializer trait.\nThere is a method serialize_bytes which serializes a &[u8]. Some formats\ntreat bytes like any other seq, but some formats are able to serialize bytes\nmore compactly. Currently Serde does not use serialize_bytes in the\nSerialize impl for &[u8] or Vec but once specialization lands in\nstable Rust we will begin using it. For now the serde_bytes crate can be\nused to enable efficient handling of &[u8] and Vec through\nserialize_bytes.\nFinally, serialize_some and serialize_none correspond to Option::Some and\nOption::None. Users tend to have different expectations around the Option\nenum compared to other enums. Serde JSON will serialize Option::None as null\nand Option::Some as just the contained value.\n"},"impl-deserialize.html":{"url":"impl-deserialize.html","title":"Implementing Deserialize","keywords":"","body":"Implementing Deserialize\nThe Deserialize trait looks like this:\npub trait Deserialize: Sized {\n    fn deserialize(deserializer: D) -> Result\n    where\n        D: Deserializer;\n}\n\nThis method's job is to map the type into the Serde data model by providing\nthe Deserializer with a Visitor that can be driven by the Deserializer\nto construct an instance of your type.\nIn most cases Serde's derive is able to generate an appropriate implementation\nof Deserialize for structs and enums defined in your crate. Should you need to\ncustomize the deserialization behavior for a type in a way that derive does not\nsupport, you can implement Deserialize yourself. Implementing Deserialize\nfor a type tends to be more complicated than implementing Serialize.\nThe Deserializer trait supports two entry point styles which enables different\nkinds of deserialization.\n\nThe deserialize_any method. Self-describing data formats like JSON are able\nto look at the serialized data and tell what it represents. For example the\nJSON deserializer may see an opening curly brace ({) and know that it is\nseeing a map. If the data format supports Deserializer::deserialize_any, it\nwill drive the Visitor using whatever type it sees in the input. JSON uses\nthis approach when deserializing serde_json::Value which is an enum that\ncan represent any JSON document. Without knowing what is in a JSON document,\nwe can deserialize it to serde_json::Value by going through\nDeserializer::deserialize_any.\n\nThe various other deserialize_* methods. Non-self-describing formats like\nPostcard need to be told what is in the input in order to deserialize it. The\ndeserialize_* methods are hints to the deserializer for how to interpret\nthe next piece of input. Non-self-describing formats are not able to\ndeserialize something like serde_json::Value which relies on\nDeserializer::deserialize_any.\n\n\nWhen implementing Deserialize, you should avoid relying on\nDeserializer::deserialize_any unless you need to be told by the Deserializer\nwhat type is in the input. Know that relying on Deserializer::deserialize_any\nmeans your data type will be able to deserialize from self-describing formats\nonly, ruling out Postcard and many others.\nThe Visitor trait\nA Visitor is instantiated by a Deserialize impl and passed to a\nDeserializer. The Deserializer then calls a method on the Visitor in order\nto construct the desired type.\nHere is a Visitor that is able to deserialize a primitive i32 from a variety\nof types.\nuse std::fmt;\n\nuse serde::de::{self, Visitor};\n\nstruct I32Visitor;\n\nimpl Visitor for I32Visitor {\n    type Value = i32;\n\n    fn expecting(&self, formatter: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {\n        formatter.write_str(\"an integer between -2^31 and 2^31\")\n    }\n\n    fn visit_i8(self, value: i8) -> Result\n    where\n        E: de::Error,\n    {\n        Ok(i32::from(value))\n    }\n\n    fn visit_i32(self, value: i32) -> Result\n    where\n        E: de::Error,\n    {\n        Ok(value)\n    }\n\n    fn visit_i64(self, value: i64) -> Result\n    where\n        E: de::Error,\n    {\n        use std::i32;\n        if value >= i64::from(i32::MIN) && value \nThe Visitor trait has lots more methods that are not implemented for\nI32Visitor. Leaving them unimplemented means a type error is returned if\nthey get called. For example I32Visitor does not implement\nVisitor::visit_map, so trying to deserialize an i32 when the input contains a\nmap is a type error.\nDriving a Visitor\nDeserialize a value by passing a Visitor to the given Deserializer. The\nDeserializer will call one of the Visitor methods depending on the input\ndata, which is known as \"driving\" the Visitor.\nimpl Deserialize for i32 {\n    fn deserialize(deserializer: D) -> Result\n    where\n        D: Deserializer,\n    {\n        deserializer.deserialize_i32(I32Visitor)\n    }\n}\n\nNote that a Deserializer will not necessarily follow the type hint, so the\ncall to deserialize_i32 does not necessarily mean the Deserializer will call\nI32Visitor::visit_i32. For example JSON treats all signed integer types alike.\nThe JSON Deserializer will call visit_i64 for any signed integer and\nvisit_u64 for any unsigned integer, even if hinted a different type.\nOther examples\n\nDeserializing a map\nDeserializing a struct\n\n"},"unit-testing.html":{"url":"unit-testing.html","title":"Unit testing","keywords":"","body":"Unit testing\nThe serde_test crate provides a convenient concise way to write unit tests\nfor implementations of Serialize and Deserialize.\nThe Serialize impl for a value can be characterized by the sequence of\nSerializer calls that are made in the course of serializing the value, so\nserde_test provides a Token abstraction which corresponds roughly to\nSerializer method calls. It provides an assert_ser_tokens function to test\nthat a value serializes into a particular sequence of method calls, an\nassert_de_tokens function to test that a value can be deserialized from a\nparticular sequence of method calls, and an assert_tokens function to test\nboth directions.

This avoids allocating memory to store a string\nfor each individual field and then copying string data out of the input over to\nthe newly allocated field. Rust guarantees that the input data outlives the\nperiod during which the output data structure is in scope, meaning it is\nimpossible to have dangling pointer errors as a result of losing the input data\nwhile the output data structure still refers to it.\nTrait bounds\nThere are two main ways to write Deserialize trait bounds, whether on an impl\nblock or a function or anywhere else.\n\n where T: Deserialize\n  This means \"T can be deserialized from some lifetime.\" The caller gets\n  to decide what lifetime that is. Typically this is used when the caller also\n  provides the data that is being deserialized from, for example in a function\n  like serde_json::from_str. In that case the input data must also have\n  lifetime 'de, for example it could be &'de str.\n\n where T: DeserializeOwned\n  This means \"T can be deserialized from any lifetime.\" The callee gets to\n  decide what lifetime. Usually this is because the data that is being\n  deserialized from is going to be thrown away before the function returns, so\n  T must not be allowed to borrow from it. For example a function that accepts\n  base64-encoded data as input, decodes it from base64, deserializes a value\n  of type T, then throws away the result of base64 decoding. Another common\n  use of this bound is functions that deserialize from an IO stream, such as\n  serde_json::from_reader.\n  To say it more technically, the DeserializeOwned trait is equivalent to\n  the higher-rank trait bound for Deserialize. The only\n  difference is DeserializeOwned is more intuitive to read. It means T owns\n  all the data that gets deserialized.\n\n\nNote that  where T: Deserialize is never what you want. Also\nDeserialize + 'static is never what you want. Generally writing 'static\nanywhere near Deserialize is a sign of being on the wrong track. Use one of\nthe above bounds instead.\nTransient, borrowed, and owned data\nThe Serde data model has three flavors of strings and byte arrays during\ndeserialization. They correspond to different methods on the Visitor trait.\n\nTransient â€” visit_str accepts a &str.\nBorrowed â€” visit_borrowed_str accepts a &'de str.\nOwned â€” visit_string accepts a String.\n\nTransient data is not guaranteed to last beyond the method call it is passed to.\nOften this is sufficient, for example when deserializing something like an IP\naddress from a Serde string using the FromStr trait. When it is not\nsufficient, the data can be copied by calling to_owned(). Deserializers\ncommonly use transient data when input from an IO stream is being buffered in\nmemory before being passed to the Visitor, or when escape sequences are being\nprocessed so the resulting string is not present verbatim in the input.\nBorrowed data is guaranteed to live at least as long as the 'de lifetime\nparameter of the Deserializer. Not all deserializers support handing out\nborrowed data. For example when deserializing from an IO stream no data can be\nborrowed.\nOwned data is guaranteed to live as long as the Visitor wants it to. Some\nvisitors benefit from receiving owned data. For example the Deserialize impl\nfor Rust's String type benefits from being given ownership of the Serde string\ndata that has been deserialized.\nThe Deserialize lifetime\nThis lifetime records the constraints on how long data borrowed by this type\nmust be valid.\nEvery lifetime of data borrowed by this type must be a bound on the 'de\nlifetime of its Deserialize impl. If this type borrows data with lifetime\n'a, then 'de must be constrained to outlive 'a.\nstruct S {\n    a: &'a str,\n    b: &'b str,\n    bb: &'b str,\n    t: T,\n}\n\nimpl Deserialize for S\nwhere\n    T: Deserialize,\n{\n    /* ... */\n}\n\nIf this type does not borrow any data from the Deserializer, there are simply\nno bounds on the 'de lifetime. Such types automatically implement the\nDeserializeOwned trait.\nstruct S {\n    owned: String,\n}\n\nimpl Deserialize for S {\n    /* ... */\n}\n\nThe 'de lifetime should not appear in the type to which the Deserialize\nimpl applies.\n- // Do not do this. Sooner or later you will be sad.\n- impl Deserialize for Q {\n\n+ // Do this instead.\n+ impl Deserialize for Q {\n\nThe Deserializer lifetime\nThis is the lifetime of data that can be borrowed from the Deserializer.\nstruct MyDeserializer {\n    input_data: &'de [u8],\n    pos: usize,\n}\n\nimpl Deserializer for MyDeserializer {\n    /* ... */\n}\n\nIf the Deserializer never invokes visit_borrowed_str or\nvisit_borrowed_bytes, the 'de lifetime will be an unconstrained lifetime\nparameter.\nstruct MyDeserializer {\n    read: R,\n}\n\nimpl Deserializer for MyDeserializer\nwhere\n    R: io::Read,\n{\n    /* ... */\n}\n\nBorrowing data in a derived impl\nFields of type &str and &[u8] are implicitly borrowed from the input data by\nSerde.

This representation is common\nin Java libraries.\nThis representation works for struct variants, newtype variants containing\nstructs or maps, and unit variants but does not work for enums containing tuple\nvariants. Using a #[serde(tag = \"...\")] attribute on an enum containing a\ntuple variant is an error at compile time.\nThe serde crate's \"alloc\" Cargo feature must be enabled to deserialize an\ninternally tagged enum.

It also removes some features of derive(Deserialize) including\nuntagged enums.\nYou can opt back in to these impls by enabling the \"alloc\" Cargo feature.\nThis configuration provides integration for heap-allocated collections without\ndepending on the rest of the Rust standard library.\n[dependencies]\nserde = { version = \"1.0\", default-features = false, features = [\"alloc\"] }\n\n"},"feature-flags.html":{"url":"feature-flags.html","title":"Feature flags","keywords":"","body":"Feature flags\nThe serde crate defines some Cargo features to enable using Serde in a\nvariety of freestanding environments.\nBuilding Serde with default-features = false, you will receive a stock\nno_std Serde with no support for any of the collection types.\n\n\nfeatures = [\"derive\"] \nProvide derive macros for the Serialize and Deserialize traits.\nThis is behind a feature because the derive macro implementation takes some\nextra time to compile.\nfeatures = [\"std\"] \nThis feature is enabled by default.\nProvide impls for common standard library types like Vec and\nHashMap.
